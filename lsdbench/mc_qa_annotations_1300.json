Let's analyze how the camera wearer handled and stored food items during the kitchen segment:\n\n1.  **Unpacking and Handling the Food:**\n\n    *   The camera wearer starts by taking a food item out of a bag, removes the polythene wrapping, and places it on a plate.\n    *   After unpackaging, the camera wearer puts some of the food item from one plate to another and then picks up a lid.\n\n2.  **Storage:**\n\n    *   After handling the food, the camera wearer places it (still on the plate) inside the refrigerator for storage.\n    *  The lid is put away and the polyethene bag is thrown away in the sink.\n\nTherefore, during food preparation, the camera wearer removed the wrappings, puts the food on a plate and some to a new plate and finally placed it into the refrigerator to store.\n",
